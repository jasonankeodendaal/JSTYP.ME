## ðŸ¤– Android APK Build (Capacitor)

This project uses **Capacitor** to wrap the web app into a native Android application. Follow these steps to generate a signed APK ready for distribution.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js (LTS version) installed.
2.  **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: You need a recent version of the JDK. We recommend OpenJDK. You can install it via your system's package manager or from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/).
3.  **Android Studio**: Download and install the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
    -   During setup, make sure to install the Android SDK Platforms and Command-line Tools.

### Step-by-Step Build Process

Follow these steps in your terminal from the **root directory** of the project.

1.  **Install All Dependencies**:
    This command will install both the web app dependencies and the Capacitor CLI tools.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Add the Android Platform**:
    This command creates the native `android` project folder that Capacitor will manage. You only need to run this once.
    ```bash
    npx cap add android
    ```

3.  **Build the Web App and Sync with Android**:
    This custom script first runs `vite build` to create an optimized production version of your web app in the `/dist` folder. Then, it runs `npx cap sync android` to copy these web assets into the native Android project.
    ```bash
    npm run build:android
    ```
    *You must run this command every time you make changes to your web code that you want to be reflected in the native app.*

4.  **Open the Project in Android Studio**:
    This command will launch Android Studio and open your native Android project.
    ```bash
    npm run open:android
    ```

5.  **Generate a Signed APK in Android Studio**:
    -   Once Android Studio opens and finishes syncing, go to the top menu and select **`Build` &rarr; `Generate Signed Bundle / APK...`**.
    -   Select **APK** and click "Next".
    -   **Key store path**: If you have a signing key, select it. If not, click **"Create new..."**.
        -   Fill out the form to create a new keystore file (e.g., `my-release-key.jks`). **Save this file and back it up securely! You will need it to publish updates.**
        -   Remember the passwords you create.
    -   Once you have selected your key, click "Next".
    -   **Build Variants**: Choose **release**.
    -   Click **"Finish"**.
    -   Android Studio will build the signed APK. When it's done, a notification will appear with a link to **"locate"** the file. The APK will typically be in `/android/app/release/app-release.apk`.

This `app-release.apk` file is your production-ready application, which you can now distribute or upload to the Google Play Store.

## Technical Overview

### The "No-Build" PWA Foundation

The most unique aspect of this application is its "build" processâ€”or rather, its lack of one. Traditional React apps use tools like Webpack or Vite to bundle all the code into a few optimized JavaScript files. This app skips that step entirely, which makes the setup incredibly simple.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

-   **`index.html` as the Orchestrator:** This is the heart of the "build." It's responsible for loading everything directly.
    -   It pulls in libraries like React and Tailwind CSS from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
    -   It uses a modern browser feature called an `<script type="importmap">`. This is the magic key. The import map acts like a directory for your browser. It tells the browser, "When you see `import React from 'react'`, go fetch it from this specific CDN URL." This is what replaces the job of a bundler.
    -   Finally, it loads your main application code with `<script type="module" src="/index.tsx">`. The `type="module"` tells the browser to treat this file as an ES Module, allowing it to use `import` and `export` statements just like a bundled app would.

-   **`manifest.json` for Installability:** This is a standard PWA file. It's a simple JSON that tells the browser the app's name, icons, theme color, and that it can be "installed" on a user's desktop or home screen. When a user installs it, the app runs in its own window, feeling more like a native application.

-   **`sw.js` (Service Worker) for Offline Capability:** This is the core of the PWA's offline power. A Service Worker is a special JavaScript file that the browser runs in the background, separate from the main web page.
    -   **Installation:** When you first visit the app, the service worker is installed. It pre-caches the essential files listed in `APP_SHELL_URLS` (like `index.html`).
    -   **Interception:** Once active, it acts like a proxy between your app and the network. When your app requests a file (e.g., an image or a script), the service worker intercepts that request.
    -   **Cache-First Strategy:** It first checks if it has a copy of the requested file in its cache. If it does, it serves it instantly from the cache without ever going to the network. This is why the app loads instantly on subsequent visits, even if you're offline. If the file isn't in the cache, it fetches it from the network, serves it to the app, and saves a copy in the cache for next time.

In summary, the "build" is just a set of instructions in `index.html` that modern browsers understand, combined with the PWA essentials (`manifest.json`, `sw.js`) to make it installable and offline-ready.

## Getting Started (Development)

### 1. Frontend Setup
- Navigate to the project's root directory.
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the development server: `npm run dev`

### 2. Backend Server Setup
- Navigate to the `/server` directory: `cd server`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- **Crucially**, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set a secure `API_KEY`.
- Run the server: `npm start`
- The server will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Production Deployment & Syncing

The recommended production setup uses a main PC as a central server and deploys the frontend to a hosting service like Vercel. Kiosk devices (PCs, Android tablets) then connect to the central server.

### Server Deployment (Main PC)

The server is designed to be run persistently using **PM2**, a process manager for Node.js. This ensures it runs 24/7 and restarts automatically.

1.  **Install PM2 Globally**:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pm2
    ```
2.  **Start Services with PM2**:
    In the `/server` directory, run:
    ```bash
    pm2 start
    ```
    This command uses `ecosystem.config.js` to start both the API server (`kiosk-api`) and a secure Cloudflare Tunnel (`kiosk-tunnel`).

3.  **Enable Automatic Startup**:
    To ensure PM2 starts on boot, run `pm2 startup` and execute the command it provides. Then, save the process list with `pm2 save`.

For detailed, user-friendly instructions on connecting the frontend to this server, please use the guides within the application itself in `Admin > System`.
